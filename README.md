# Math Village - Web game platform
[Math Village](http://www.students.oamk.fi/~t6dath00/mathvillage/index.php "Live demo") is a personal project that I developed at my university for my course Software Development Project 1. It is a web game platform that helps young kids improve their math skills in a more engaging and interesting way, compared to traditional math homework. In other word, this system is designed to assist young children, possibly ranging from grade 1 to grade 5, to learn math by playing games that are both educational and entertaining. The design of the webpage brings both a friendly look for children and professional look for the parents. Its responsiveness also makes users feel at ease regardless of devices they use to browse the website.
